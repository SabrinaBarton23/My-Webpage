<h1> My Portfolio: Sabrina Barton </h1>

<p> My name is Sabrina Barton. I was born in Manhattan, New York City, on October 23, 2002. I currently live in Manhattan with my parents and our three cats. I went to elementary school at P.S. 11, the local school, for six years, and then I briefly attended LAB Middle School for 6th grade before being accepted to Hunter College High School, where I am now a 9th grader. I have always been very academically inclined, and not very good at sports. Although I have no siblings, I am very close with my first cousin Dawn, who is 27, and her 5 year old son Julian. I am also close with my two remaining grandparents, one of whom served in the AirForce during World War II. Overall, I would describe myself as a very shy, introverted, studious, good at procrastinating, and silly person. I was classified as an INTJ by the Meyers- Briggs test, a personality test that has been shown to be extremely accurate. </p>

<h2> My Hopes and Dreams for the Future: </h2>
<p> Although, unlike some people, I don't have a clear idea of what I want to do when I'm older, I'm interested in medicine, and so I want to be a neurosurgeon when I'm an adult. I hope that I travel a lot, and perhaps live in a big city other than New York, at least for a little while. </p>
